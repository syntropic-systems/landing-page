    question: 'How is Cloudglance different from generic AI tools like ChatGPT?',
    answer: 'Generic AI tools hallucinate, can\'t handle large technical documents and don\'t support accuracy, collaboration or end-to-end workflows. Cloudglance fixes all of this by processing thousands of pages reliably with citations, maintaining high accuracy and powering complete operational workflows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast is onboarding?',
    answer: 'Onboarding is immediate. You can start using Cloudglance the same day you sign up. If you need company-specific customisations, that may take a little additional time depending on the scope.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What file types can Cloudglance read?',
    answer: 'Almost all common formats: PDFs, Word, Excel, images, drawings and scanned docs. Even complex tables, BOQs and multi-structure files are read and processed into structured data.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Cloudglance only work for tenders?',
    answer: 'No. Any process that is document-heavy and you want to cut time on review, extraction or compliance, Cloudglance can help.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much training does my team need?',
    answer: 'None. On the day of onboarding, we will run a personalised demo before your team starts using the platform. If your team faces any trouble, our customer success team is always available for support.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we keep using our existing tools?',
    answer: 'Yes. Cloudglance integrates with drives, ERPs, SSO and document systems so you can keep your current workflows and start working from day one.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate is the AI?',
    answer: 'We measure very high accuracy in our extraction and compliance checks (internal benchmarks ~99.7%). Every extracted item includes a citation so teams can verify the source quickly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you handle company-specific templates and terminology?',
    answer: 'Yes. Organisation-specific formats and terminology are covered through our customisation process so the platform works reliably with your templates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Cloudglance secure?',
    answer: 'Enterprise-grade security by default: encryption at rest and in transit, tenant isolation, role-based access, audit logs and strict data handling. We\'re also in the process of SOC2 and ISO certification applications.',
