    question: 'How is Cloudglance different from generic AI tools like ChatGPT?',
    answer: 'Generic AI tools hallucinate, can\'t handle large technical documents and don\'t support accuracy, collaboration or end-to-end workflows. Cloudglance fixes all of this by processing thousands of pages reliably with citations, maintaining high accuracy and powering complete operational workflows.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does CloudGlance handle security and compliance?',
    answer: 'CloudGlance is built with enterprise-grade security from the ground up. All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3), with strict tenant isolation, role-based access controls, and full audit logging. We are currently completing SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification processes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast is onboarding?',
    answer: 'Onboarding is immediate. You can start using Cloudglance the same day you sign up. If you need company-specific customisations, that may take a little additional time depending on the scope.',

  {
    question: 'What file types can Cloudglance read?',

    question: 'Does Cloudglance only work for tenders?',
    answer: 'No. Any process that is document-heavy and you want to cut time on review, extraction or compliance, Cloudglance can help.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much training does my team need?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can we keep using our existing tools?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Does Cloudglance encrypt data?',
