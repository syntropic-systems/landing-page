      "title": "Verifiable, Hallucination-Free Answers",
      "problem": "Off-the-shelf models are prone to 'hallucinating'â€”making up facts when they don't know the answer.",
      "solution": "Every answer is cited back to the exact page and passage in your source documents. No guesswork, just facts."

      "title": "True Customization & Contextual Fit",
      "problem": "Generic models don't speak your industry's language. Their responses sound like boilerplate AI.",
      "solution": "Our AI is trained on your bids, specs, and clauses. It learns your unique style and terminology."

      "title": "Unbreakable Security & Control",
      "problem": "Sending your sensitive bid data to third-party APIs is a massive compliance risk.",
      "solution": "Your data never leaves our secure environment. We offer flexible on-premise deployment and provide a complete, unchangeable audit trail."

      "title": "Unmatched Speed & Efficiency",
      "problem": "Standard AI models re-compute every query from scratch, making them slow and inefficient.",
      "solution": "Our optimized retrieval system and cached memory provide near-instant answers. A 200+ page proposal can be fully analyzed for Q&A in minutes."
