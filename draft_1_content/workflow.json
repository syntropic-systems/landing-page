It starts on the left with a 'chaotic' cloud of various icons representing different file types (PDF, DOCX, image, etc.) flowing into a central, sleek box labeled 'CloudGlance AI Core.' Inside the core, an animation shows the files being read, with lines connecting to a central, glowing knowledge base node labeled 'Unified Content Library.' This node then connects to three distinct, strategic outputs on the right."
