# Project Structure

The project is a modern React application built with Vite and TypeScript. It follows a well-organized and scalable folder structure that separates concerns and makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.

## Key Directories

### `src`

This is the heart of the application, containing all the source code.

*   **`src/assets`**: This directory holds all the images and other static assets that are imported directly into the React components.

*   **`src/components`**: This is where all the React components live. The components are further organized into three subdirectories:
    *   **`common`**: This directory contains small, reusable components that can be used anywhere in the application, such as `Button`, `Card`, and `Badge`.
    *   **`layout`**: This directory contains the main layout components of the application, such as the `Navbar` and `Footer`.
    *   **`sections`**: This directory contains the major sections of the landing page, such as `Hero`, `Features`, and `Services`. Each section is a self-contained component that fetches its own data and manages its own state.

*   **`src/hooks`**: This directory contains custom React hooks. The `useContent.ts` hook is a key part of the application's data fetching strategy.

*   **`src/styles`**: This directory contains the global stylesheets. `globals.css` defines the design tokens and base styles, while `utilities.css` provides a set of utility classes for common styling tasks.

*   **`src/types`**: This directory contains all the TypeScript type definitions for the application, primarily for the content fetched from the JSON files.

### `content`

This directory contains the JSON files that hold all the content for the landing page. This separation of content and presentation is a key architectural feature of the project. It allows for easy content updates without needing to modify the React components. Each major component or section has its own corresponding JSON file.

### `docs`

This directory contains all the project documentation, including this file.

### `screenshots`

This directory is used to store the automated screenshots generated by the `screenshot.js` script.

### `public`

This directory contains static assets that are not processed by the build tool and are served directly from the root of the application.

## Configuration Files

*   **`package.json`**: This file defines the project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.
*   **`vite.config.ts`**: This file contains the configuration for Vite, the build tool used in this project.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler.
