## Task: Smooth Navbar Transition

### 1. Current State

The navigation bar is a fully functional, data-driven component with the following features:

- **Sticky Positioning**: The navbar is fixed to the top of the page.
- **Dynamic Content**: The navigation links and brand information are loaded from `content/navbar_new.json`.
- **Responsive Design**: The navbar adapts to different screen sizes, with a mobile-friendly layout.
- **Scroll-Based Animations**: The navbar transitions to a "pill" shape on scroll, with the following changes:
  - The background becomes a blurred, glassmorphism effect.
  - The width of the navbar shrinks.
  - The "Request Demo" button appears.
- **Interactive Elements**: The navigation links smoothly scroll to different sections of the page, and the "Request Demo" button opens a modal dialog.

### 2. The Plan

The current animation is functional but lacks the fluidity of a high-quality user interface. The goal is to create a smooth, seamless transition with an organic feel, using acceleration and deceleration effects.

To achieve this, I will make the following changes:

- [ ] **Leverage Framer Motion**: I will use the `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks from Framer Motion to create a more sophisticated animation.
- [ ] **Isolate Animated Components**: I will break down the animation into three distinct parts:
  - The navigation links in the center.
  - The logo on the left.
  - The action buttons on the right.
- [ ] **Animate Individual Elements**: I will apply separate animations to each component:
  - **Center Content**: The navigation links will smoothly fade out and slide down as the user scrolls.
  - **Left and Right Content**: The logo and action buttons will smoothly translate towards the center.
- [ ] **Refine Transitions**: I will fine-tune the animation curves to create a natural acceleration and deceleration effect, making the transition feel polished and responsive.
- [ ] **Cleanup**: I will remove any old, unused animation logic to ensure the new implementation is clean and efficient.
